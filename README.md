# Linear-Regression
Train the model using linear regression. Perform classification and cross-validation using the trained model.

Linear Regression is an approach to model the relationship between input
variables and the output. We try to fit the datapoints using a line/plane in such 
a way that root mean square error (RMSE) calculated by the difference between 
target output and the predicted output is minimum.
